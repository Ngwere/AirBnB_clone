# AirBnB clone


## Description of the Project

This is my AirBnB clone project that was completed to test my skills on the software engineering concepts I have beeen studying for the passed 5 months. The goal of the project is to deploy a working replica of AirBnB website on my servert. The final version of the project will have;
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)
- A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities
- A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

## Concepts in Review

* How to create a Python package
* How to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
* What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
* How to serialize and deserialize a Class
* How to write and read a JSON file
* How to manage datetime
* What is an UUID
* What is *args and how to use it
* What is **kwargs and how to use it
* How to handle named arguments in a function

## Description of the Command Interpreter
|Commands|Description|
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|quit|Quits the console|
|Ctrl+D|Quits the console|
|help or help <command>|Displays all commands or Displays instructions for a specific command|
|create <class>|Creates an object of type , saves it to a JSON file, and prints the objects ID|
|show <class> <ID>|Shows string representation of an object|
|destroy <class> <ID>:Deletes an objects:
|all or all <class>|Prints all string representations of all objects or Prints all string representations of all objects of a specific class|
|update <class> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"|Updates an object with a certain attribute (new or existing)|
|<class>.all()|Same as all <class>|
|<class>.count()|Retrieves the number of objects of a certain class|
|<class>.show(<ID>)|Same as show <class> <ID>|
|<class>.destroy(<ID>)|Same as destroy <class> <ID>|
|<class>.update(<ID>, <attribute name>, <attribute value>|Same as update <class> <ID> <attribute name> <attribute value>|
|<class>.update(<ID>, <dictionary representation>)|Updates an objects based on a dictionary representation of attribute names and values|
The shell interpreter will work both in interactive and non interactive mode

In interactive mode, this is how it how you start it and how you use it:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

In noninteractive mode, the shell works like this

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
